      <h2>Route Running</h2>

    <p>This is what determines how good of a recevier you are with your route running</p>
    <p>Route running is all about your technique, without technique then you won't be able to run good routes</p>
    <p>Route running comes a lot with repetition and details</p>
    <p>You have to get in and out of your breaks fast so a cornerback won't cut off your route</p>
    <p>The biggest thing when it comes to route running is how much seperation can you create with your routes</p>
    <p>Creating that seperation with your routes helps you become more of a target with your quaterback and just create that confidence inside that will help you make that play</p>
    <p>Knowing how to adjust with your body and the speed you have is also key to running good routes</p>
    <p>Most of the time, it is the little things within running your route such as how many steps it takes to break down or just keeping your shoulders down to not give away your your to the cornerback</p>

    <h2>Footwork</h2>
    <p>This is very crucial to being a great wide recevier because going against cornerbacks, they have quick feet as well and whoever has the quicker footwork will win the matchup.</p>
    <p>Best way to get faster feet is to use a foot ladder and do ladder drills</p>
    <p>Consistenly doing ladder drills will definitely help you get quicker feet</p>
    <p>Another way is to do cone drills which helps with your footwork and at the same time your agility as well</p>
    <p>Doing cone drills will help you move more fluient in and out of your breaks and comfortably adjusting to certain movements</p>
    <p>Most of the drills that you do will translate to your game on the field as well</p>
