          <p>The England country took over the island in 1655 and started to make an economy that was based on sugar, cocoa, and coffee.</p>
          <p>African slaves were taken to this country to replace the native tino who were in that country for centuries</p>
          <p>Slaves were later freed because slavery was abolished in 1834 and became framers because of how deep the plantation roots were there</p>
